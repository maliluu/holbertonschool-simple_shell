as a shell function by that name. Then it looks for a builtin command by that name. If a builtin command is not found, one of two things happen:

1. Command names containing a slash are simply executed without performing any searches.

2. The shell searches each entry in PATH in turn for the command. The value of the PATH variable should be a series of entries separated by colons. Each entry consists of a directory name. The current directory may be indicated implicitly by an empty directory name, or explicitly by a single period.
